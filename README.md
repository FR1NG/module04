# module04
the module 04 in cpp piscine

## in this moduel we goint to learn about 3 topics :
- subtype polymorphisme
- abstract classes
- interfaces

### first what is polymorphism and what is the types of polymorphism ?
#### first thing first , what is the polymorphism means ?
the polymorphism means that an entity (function or object ) can behave diffirently int different scenarios.
#### types of polymorphism :
there are four types of polymorphism :

1. subtype polymorphism (known also as run time polymorphism).
2. parametric polymorphism (known also as parametric polymorphism).
3. ad-hoc polymorphism (known also as overloading).
4. coercion polymorphism (known also as casting).

we are going to talk about each of them separatly.

##### subtype polymorphism (run time)
	the subtype polymorphism is when you try to derive a class using a pointe referance of the base class,
	soo if we call for exemle a mumber function that has been inherited from the base class and overloader in the derived class , the base class inestance of the mumber function will be called, example bellow.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
